# algoritms
React app that simulates simple comparison sorting algorithms and animates them. 
Still needs a lot of polishing. I am updating the styles and adding new algorithms and unit testing when I have free time.
Used npm create-react-app to bootstrap this application 
web-stack includes JavaScript ES5 & ES6, ReactJS (Hooks) and Html/CSS
